# JavaExercise
When I was learning Java, I practice coding a lot. After you watch the tutorial vedio, you need to code by yourself to get familiar with the concepts.<br>
I have uploaded some of the practise problems and solutions I wrote.<br>
This repo contains the following problem:<br>
<br>
1).numberGuessGame<br>
2).charStreamExercise<br>
3).UDPCommunicationProgram<br>
