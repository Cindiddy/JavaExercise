# JavaExercise
When I was learning Java, I practice coding a lot. After you watch the tutorial vedio, you need to code by yourself to get familiar with the concepts.
I have uploaded some of the practise problems and solutions I wrote.
This repo contains the following problem:

1).numberGuessGame
2).charStreamExercise
3).UDPCommunicationProgram
